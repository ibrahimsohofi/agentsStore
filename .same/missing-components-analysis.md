# Missing Components Analysis - AI Agents Store

## üîç Project Summary

This is a **comprehensive and well-architected AI agent marketplace** built with modern technologies. The project is approximately **80-85% complete** with excellent foundation work, but requires several critical components to be production-ready.

## ‚ùå Critical Missing Components

- All environment variables need to be manually configured

**Required Variables:**
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# Auth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-here"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Stripe (Critical for payments)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."

# OAuth (Optional but expected)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="..."
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
GITHUB_ID="..."
GITHUB_SECRET="..."

# AI Features (Optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### 2. **Database Connection Issues**
